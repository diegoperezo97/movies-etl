## Overview of the Analysis
* Amazing Prime Video is the world's leading online retailer's streaming platform for movies and television shows. The Amazing Prime video team wants to create an algorithm that can anticipate which low-budget films will become popular and then buy the streaming rights for a low price. 
* Amazing Prime has decided to fund a hackathon in order to motivate the team, have some fun, and engage with the local coding community. Giving participants a clean data set of movie data and asking them to guess the most popular films. Britta, a member of the Amazing Prime video team, has been assigned the duty of creating the hackathon datasets.

### Purpose
